# Alignment Chart Generator üßêü§î

### Description
Welcome to the Alignment Chart Generator, a web application that maps people, things, or ideas along two dimensions: (1) lawful vs. chaotic, and (2) good vs. evil.

Combining these dimensions, we get nine different alignments that things can fall into:
1. Lawful good
2. Neutral good
3. Chaotic good
4. Lawful neutral
5. True neutral
6. Chaotic neutral
7. Lawful evil
8. Neutral evil
9. Chaotic evil

The alignment chart originated in the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) fantasy role-playing game to allow players to categorize their characters according to their moral and ethical values. Today, it has exploded in popularity across mainstream pop culture.

### How to Use
1. Sign up or log in using existing credentials.
2. Enter a person, thing, or idea in the "Item to be aligned" input and click on "Submit."
3. Once the item has been initialized, a dropdown menu appears, allowing you to select an alignment for the item.
4. Select an alignment, and the item will move to its specified grid in the 3x3 chart.
5. You can change an item's alignment by simply selecting a new dropdown option. You can also delete items altogether.
